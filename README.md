# 2020-09-17, Things to learn

* Gan: Liquidhaskell
    * pros: closely related to the research and we're already somewhat familiar
      with it
    * cons: it's a little ugly; it mashes a bunch of different things together
* Patrick: Idris
    * pros: it's more organized than LH
    * cons: (Gan: we don't know how to use it in the research, textbook doesn't
      seem to be free)
* Gan: agda (similar to idris, but less focused on being a general purpose
  language, and more focused on being a theorem prover)
    * pros: i found a great textbook <https://plfa.github.io/>, to keep us moving

# 2020-09-17, Discussion of goals

* Gan:
    * We have diverged from the initial goals.  Goal was: build a collaborative
      editor.  We've spent a lot of time dicsussing the network framework.
      TBH, i'm not interested in this part.  It's an interesting problem, but
      it's very ambitious, and it's not my current research or interest.
* Patrick:
    * That's all true. What do you want to do next?
* Gan:
    * Let's just focus on the collaborative editor and make it work. Let's just
      finish it.  I think a lot of the work left is UI work; how to make the
      interface intuitive.  We have other work. Maybe we could show eachother
      what we're working on?
* Patrick:
    * On some level, this project is now a distraction, because we are about to
      have classes and we also have work to submit to PLDI (hopefully).
    * We've accomplished our goal of getting to eachother.  We've found where
      the difficalt parts of building a collaborative editor are: UI/UX, some
      network stuff, and the UX of an editing session.
    * What do you want to do?
        * Gan: Finish the editor.
        * Gan: Talk about our current work/research.
        * Patrick: We could also work on eachothers projects during this
          meeting.
        * Gan: Learn something together? Eg. LH, without applying to our
          research.  Eg. things I've always wanted to learn by myself but
          haven't had the time.
            * Patrick: I like this idea alot.
            * Gan: We don't have to invent our own goals, which makes this a
              little easier.
* Patrick:
    * Let's figure out a list of things to learn! (see list above)
* Gan: What are our criteria?
    1. Have fun: Pick something we want to learn.
    2. Be useful: It should be somewhat related to our research (eg. not
    chemistry).
    3. It shouldn't be a time suck; it shouldn't be super serious or ambitious.
